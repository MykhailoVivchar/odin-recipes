        <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                We make dough fordumplings.
                <br>
                Beat an egg into slightly heated water, add salt 
                and mix thoroughly. Gradually add flour and mix well 
                so that the result is a fairly dense and elastic dough.
                We wrap it in a film and leave it for 30-40 minutes.
                "reach".
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the filling.
                <br>
                At this time, we prepare the filling, for which we boil
                 peeled potatoes in slightly salted water. Clean and 
                 chop the onion, which should be lightly saut√©ed in 
                 vegetable oil until golden. Mash the hot potatoes 
                 well and combine with fried onions, pepper to taste.
            </li>
            <li>
                Knead the dough.
                <br>
                Knead the dough once more and prepare portioned "cakes" in
                a way that is convenient for you, into which we place 
                the slightly cooled filling. Carefully fasten the edges 
                of the dough, and boil the dumplings with potatoes for
                5-7 minutes. (until they float) in slightly salted water. 
                The finished dish with sour cream tastes especially good.
