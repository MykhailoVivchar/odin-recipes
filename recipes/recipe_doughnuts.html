        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix yeast, sugar, salt, warm water 
                and 5 tablespoons of sifted flour 
                in a cup. Mix, cover with a lid or 
                a plate, leave in a dark, dry place
                for 20-30 minutes.
                </li>
            <li>
                After that, pour vegetable oil and
                pour the remaining sifted flour. 
                Stir the dough with a spoon, and 
                then knead it thoroughly with your 
                hands. Grease a deep container with 
                oil, put the dough in it, cover with 
                a bag and put it in a warm place for 
                1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel, boil, salt and mash the 
                potatoes. Peel the onion, cut into 
                cubes, fry in oil until cooked, add 
                to the puree and mix. Sprinkle the 
                table with flour, take out the dough,
                tear off several pieces from it. 
                Form balls from them, leave them for 
                10-15 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then make cakes from the balls, put 
                the filling on each one and pinch the 
                edges of the dough. Pour oil into the 
                pan, lay out the dough, fry the 
                patties on both sides until golden.
