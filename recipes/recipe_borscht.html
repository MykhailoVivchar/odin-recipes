    <h2>Description of the dish</h2>
    <p>
        Borsch is a cultural heritage of Ukraine, o
        ur pride and a culinary symbol of our country. 
        It is simply impossible to be indifferent 
        to this thick rich soup.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many borscht recipes and almost 
        every housewife has her own. Someone likes 
        borscht with beans, someone cooks it without
        cabbage, and someone cooks it with mushrooms.
        Quite often, borscht recipes in families are 
        carefully passed down from generation 
        to generation, and some are even kept in 
        strict secrecy.

        <h3>Recipe instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                First, we cook the broth. Pour 1.5-2 
                liters of water into the pot. Add meat 
                and put on medium heat. Before boiling, 
                remove the foam. As soon as the broth
                boils, cover with a lid and cook over 
                low heat for an hour to an hour and 
                a half.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the meantime, we are preparing the 
                roast. We clean beets, carrots and onions.
                Grate the beets on a coarse grater, and
                grate the carrots on a medium grater. 
                Cut the onion into cubes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a frying pan over medium heat,
                add onions and carrots and fry for 5 minutes. 
                Then we add the beet (it can be sprinkled with 
                citric acid or sprinkled with fresh lemon juice
                - this way the borscht will be really red). Fry 
                the vegetables for another 5 minutes, add tomato
                 paste, mix and fry for another 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                And now we cook the borscht itself. Remove the 
                meat from the broth and, while it is cooling, 
                throw the shredded cabbage into the broth. After 
                5-10 minutes, add potatoes cut into strips. 
                Separate the meat from the bone and cut into 
                cubes. We return the meat to the borscht, salt 
                it and add roasting. Stir the borscht, add the 
                bay leaf and finely chopped greens, cover with 
                a lid and cook for another 5-7 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                We serve borscht with sour cream and greens.
            </li>
        </ol>
